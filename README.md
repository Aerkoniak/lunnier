### Demo: https://lunnier.com 


The lunnier project is a fairly simple demonstration website. An application created with React.js and React Router that renders two separate views, one interactive for the desktop version and a simpler one supported by my favorite parallax effect.

Created with responsiveness in mind, it uses the Bootstrap library and its own breakpoints for various screen sizes.

For visual effects, I used typed.js and AOS libraries.
